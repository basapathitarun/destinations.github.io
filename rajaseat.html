        Raja’s seat is a small pavilion made of brick and mortar. Four pillars surround it and the pillars are bridged by arches. The structure
        is built on a high level ground that is enhanced by wonderful surroundings. It is due to the beauty of the place that the kings of Kodagu 
        preferred spending time with their queens in this lovely ambiance. An added attraction is a toy train. This lovely train takes adults and
        children around the park to enjoy a view of the mountains as well as the Raja’s seat from a distance.
