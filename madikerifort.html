                The long history of the Madikeri Fort can be traced back to the 17th century when Muddu Raja had made Madikeri the 
                capital of Coorg. The fort was built as a mud structure. The king had also constructed a mud palace inside the font
             premises.
           </p>
           <p>
                However, when Tipu Sultan captured the fort, he ordered to reconstruct the structure in granite and named the site 
              Jaffarabad. The rule of Tipu Sultan over the fort was cut short by Dodda Virarajendra who captured the fort in 1790. 
              The fort faced further changes and renovations during the period 1812 – 1814 when it came under the rule of Lingaraj
             endra Wodeyar II. In 1834 the fort was captured by the British rulers of India. These British rulers went on to make
             further additions and modifications to the fort and the structures within its solid walls.

          <h2> The uniqueness of Madikeri Fort, Coorg</h2>
           <p>
   
                Madikeri Fort is a unique fort that houses among other structures a temple, an Anglican Church, a 
               prison and a museum. The fact that a Church stands within the walls of the fort signifies the 
               dominance of the British people over the fort. The St. Marks Church was built by the British in 1855 
               by removing a temple of Virabhadra from the inner fort and making place for the construction of the 
              church. It was built in the Gothic style with stained glasses windows.    
          </p>
           <p>
              The fort is believed to have a few secret passageways and that adds to the mystery of the fort.

              The Madikeri Fort showcases beautiful architectural designs. Two life-size stone replicas of elephants stand in 
             the north-east corner and draw the attention of the visitors upon their entrance to the fort. The palace structure 
               is a huge and spacious one. This two storied structure is 110 feet in length. The structure was renovated twice by
                the British rulers. In 1933 they added a grand clock tower to the fort. They also built a portico to park the 
               commissioner’s car.

                The palace also has a sculpture of a tortoise with the initials of King Vijayarajendra etched on it. The fort has
                a small square mantapa built of stone and enriched by beautiful surroundings. It stands on a high level ground and 
               provides a splendid view of the surrounding areas to the west. This mantapa is believed to have been a favourite 
               spot for relaxation of the erstwhile kings of the fort.

                Madikeri Fort: A linking between the past and the present

            <p> 


                  The Madikeri Fort exists as a unique link between the present and the past. The St. Marks Church has been converted 
                 into a museum under the management of the State Archaeological Department. This museum preserves several historical
                  artefacts and antique items related to the fort and the surrounding areas. The artefacts are mainly from the British
                 rule era. A section of the museum is dedicated to awards and honours bestowed upon Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa from 
                  the Indian Army and Kodagu’s eminent personality.
