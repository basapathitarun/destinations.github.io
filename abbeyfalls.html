           This stunning waterfall in Coorg is formed by the confluence of several small mountain streams. After cascading down the cliff, Abbey 
           Falls meets river Kaveri as one of its tributaries. During the monsoon season, when the streams widen and large volumes of water gush 
           down to the pool below, the waterfall is a sight to behold.
