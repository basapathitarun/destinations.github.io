            Kodagu is one of the most picturesque places in South India. More popularly 
            referred to as Coorg, this region is an impressive attraction in Karnataka.
            Madikeri (sometimes also called Mercara) is the capital of this region and 
            the origin of the Cauvery River that forms the soul of south Indian civili
            zation. Despite being a centre of great importance in southern history,Madi
            keri in particular, and Coorg in general, retain an air of unself-conscious 
            beauty, waiting to be discovered by the next tourist who drives into the he
            artland of screen along the western ghats. Bound by the mesmerising beauty of
            the Arabian Sea,Coorg is perfect for those who seek some away time from the 
            hectic ways of urban living.Thick dense rainforests, greenery all around,
            sweet aroma of black pepper and cardamom, rich coffee plantations, and cool 
            hilly terrain – Coorg is indeed the hiddenjewel of South India. The austere 
            serenity of Coorg can only be rivaled by its colourful and vivid culture – a
            glorious marriage of natural beauty and human endeavour. Despite witnessing
            a heavy footfall of tourists in the past few years, Coorg remains largely 
            unpolluted and unspoilt. The views and the natural beauty of the region are 
            simply breathtaking. Not for nothing is Coorg referred to as the ‘Scotland 
            of India’.
